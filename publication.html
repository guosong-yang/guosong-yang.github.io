This result unifies and extends several small-gain theorems for hybrid and impulsive systems proposed in the last few years. We also show how average dwell-time (ADT) clocks and reverse ADT clocks can be used to modify the Lyapunov functions for subsystems and to enlarge the applicability of the derived small-gain theorems.

We show that, providing the switching signals neither switch too frequently nor activate non-ISS subsystems for too long, a small-gain theorem can be used to conclude global asymptotic stability (GAS) of the interconnected system. For each switched system, with the constraints on the switching signal being modeled by an auxiliary timer, a correspondent hybrid system is defined to enable the construction of a hybrid ISS Lyapunov function. Apart from justifying the ISS property of their corresponding switched systems, these hybrid ISS Lyapunov functions are then combined to establish a Lyapunov-type small-gain condition which guarantees that the interconnected system is globally asymptotically stable.

We analyze two existing methods of constructing Lyapunov functions for the interconnection based on candidate ISS Lyapunov functions for subsystems, small-gain conditions, and auxiliary timers modeling restrictions on jump frequency in terms of average dwell-time and reverse average dwell-time. We compare their feasibility and limitations for different types of subsystem dynamics, and examine a case that the combination of them is needed to establish global asymptotic stability.

The switching is slow in the sense of combined dwell-time and average dwell-time, while the active mode is unknown except at sampling times. Each mode of the switched system is stabilizable, and the disturbance admits an unknown bound. A communication and control strategy is designed to achieve practical stability and exponential convergence w.r.t. the initial state with a nonlinear gain on the disturbance, provided the data-rate meets given lower bounds. Compared with previous results, a more involved algorithm is developed to handle effects of the unknown disturbance based on employing an iteratively updated estimate of the disturbance bound and expanding the over-approximations of reachable sets over sampling intervals from the case without disturbance.

The switching is assumed to be slow in the sense of combined dwell-time and average dwell-time, while the active mode is unknown except at sampling times. Each mode of the switched linear system is assumed to be stabilizable, and the magnitude of the disturbance is constrained by a known bound. A communication and control strategy is designed to guarantee bounded-input-bounded-state (BIBS) stability of the switched linear system and an exponential convergence rate with respect to the initial state, providing the data rate satisfies certain lower bounds. Such lower bounds are established by expanding the over-approximation bounds of reachable sets over sampling intervals derived in a previous paper to accommodate effects of the disturbance.

We show that, providing the switching signal neither switches too frequently nor activates non-ISS subsystems for too long, a hybrid ISS Lyapunov function can be constructed to guarantee ISS of the switched system. With the constraints on the switching signal being modeled by a novel auxiliary timer, a hybrid system is defined so that the solutions to the two systems are correspondent. After the construction and verification of an ISS Lyapunov function, ISS of all complete solutions to the hybrid system, and therefore all solutions to the switched system, is conveniently proved.
