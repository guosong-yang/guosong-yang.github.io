		<p class="abs">We study the problem of stabilizing a switched linear system with a completely unknown disturbance using sampled and quantized state feedback. The switching is assumed to be slow enough in the sense of combined dwell-time and average dwell-time, each individual mode is assumed to be stabilizable, and the data rate is assumed to be large enough but finite. By extending the approach of reachable-set approximation and propagation from an earlier result on the disturbance-free case, we develop a communication and control strategy that achieves a variant of input-to-state stability with exponential decay. An estimate of the disturbance bound is introduced to counteract the unknown disturbance, and a novel algorithm is designed to adjust the estimate and recover the state when it escapes the range of quantization.</p>

		<p class="abs">This paper studies the impact of clock mismatches and quantization on networked control systems. We consider a scenario where the plant's state is measured by a sensor that communicates with the controller through a network. Variable communication delays and clock jitter do not permit a perfect synchronization between the clocks of the sensor and controller. We investigate limitations on the clock offset tolerable for stabilization of the feedback system. For a process with a scalar-valued state, we show that there exists a tight bound on the offset above which the closed-loop system cannot be stabilized with any causal controllers. For higher dimensional plants, if the plant has two distinct poles, then the effect of clock mismatches can be canceled with a finite number of measurements, and hence there is no fundamental limitation. We also consider the case where the measurements are subject to quantization in addition to clock mismatches. For first-order plants, we present necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for stabilizability, which show that a larger clock offset requires a finer quantization.</p>

		<p class="abs">Stability of an interconnected system consisting of two switched systems is investigated in the scenario where in both switched systems there may exist some subsystems that are not input-to-state stable (non-ISS). We show that, providing the switching signals neither switch too frequently nor activate non-ISS subsystems for too long, a small-gain theorem can be used to conclude global asymptotic stability (GAS) of the interconnected system. For each switched system, with the constraints on the switching signal being modeled by an auxiliary timer, a correspondent hybrid system is defined to enable the construction of a hybrid ISS Lyapunov function. Apart from justifying the ISS property of their corresponding switched systems, these hybrid ISS Lyapunov functions are then combined to establish a Lyapunov-type small-gain condition which guarantees that the interconnected system is globally asymptotically stable.</p>

		<p class="abs">This paper studies topological entropy and stability properties of switched linear systems. First, we show that the exponential growth rates of solutions of a switched linear system are essentially upper bounded by its topological entropy. Second, we estimate the topological entropy of a switched linear system by decomposing it into a part that is generated by scalar multiples of the identity matrix and a part that has zero entropy, and proving that the overall topological entropy is upper bounded by that of the former. Third, we prove that a switched linear system is globally exponentially stable if its topological entropy remains zero under a destabilizing perturbation. Finally, the entropy estimation via decomposition and the entropy-based stability condition are applied to three classes of switched linear systems to construct novel upper bounds for topological entropy and novel sufficient conditions for global exponential stability.</p>

		<p class="abs">We study a notion of topological entropy for switched systems, formulated in terms of the minimal number of initial states needed to approximate all initial states within a finite precision. This paper focuses on the topological entropy of switched linear systems with pairwise commuting matrices. First, we prove there exists a simultaneous change of basis under which each of the matrices can be decomposed into a diagonal part and a nilpotent part, and all the diagonal and nilpotent parts are pairwise commuting. Then a formula for the topological entropy is established in terms of the component-wise averages of the eigenvalues, weighted by the active time of each mode, which indicates that the topological entropy is independent of the nilpotent parts above. We also present how the formula generalizes known results for the non-switched case and the case with simultaneously diagonalizable matrices, and construct more general but more conservative upper bounds for the entropy. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate properties of the formula and the upper and lower bounds for the topological entropy.</p>

		<p class="abs">This paper introduces a notion of topological entropy for switched systems, formulated using the minimal number of initial states needed to approximate all initial states within a finite precision. We show that it can be equivalently defined using the maximal number of initial states separable within a finite precision, and introduce switching-related quantities such as the active time of each mode, which prove to be useful in calculating the topological entropy of switched linear systems. For general switched linear systems, we show that the topological entropy is independent of the set of initial states, and establish upper and lower bounds using the active-timeweighted averages of the norms and traces of system matrices in individual modes, respectively. For switched linear systems with scalar-valued state or simultaneously diagonalizable matrices, we derive formulae for the topological entropy using activetime-weighted averages of eigenvalues, which can be extended to the case with simultaneously triangularizable matrices to obtain an upper bound. In these three cases with special matrix structure, we also provide more general but more conservative upper bounds for the topological entropy.</p>

A dynamical system model is formulated for analyzing the effect of Coremelt attack on a single-link Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) network and developing mitigation methods. For the case with a limited number of subverted sources, a modified TCP algorithm is developed for the attackers to achieve a desired congestion level. A mitigation method is proposed to improve the link usage of legitimate users when the link is under attack. The network performance under different attack and mitigation scenarios is illustrated through simulation results.</p>

			<p class="abs more">First, we study input-to-state practical stability (ISpS) of interconnections of two switched nonlinear subsystems with independent switchings and possibly non-ISpS modes. Provided that for each subsystem, the switching is slow in the sense of an average dwell-time (ADT), and the total active time of non-ISpS modes is short in proportion, Lyapunov-based small-gain theorems are established via hybrid system techniques. By augmenting each subsystem with a hybrid auxiliary timer that models the constraints on switching, we enable a construction of hybrid ISpS-Lyapunov functions, and consequently, a convenient formulation of a small-gain condition for ISpS of the interconnection. Based on our small-gain theorem, we demonstrate the stabilization of interconnected switched control-affine systems using gain-assignment techniques.</p>
			<p class="abs more">Second, we investigate input-to-state stability (ISS) of networks composed of n &ge; 2 hybrid subsystems with possibly non-ISS dynamics. Lyapunov-based small-gain theorems are established based on the notion of candidate ISS-Lyapunov functions, which unifies and extends several previous results for interconnected hybrid and impulsive systems. In order to apply our small-gain theorem to different combinations of non-ISS dynamics, we adopt the method of modifying candidate exponential ISS-Lyapunov functions using ADT and reverse ADT timers. The effect of such modiffcations on the Lyapunov feedback gains between two interconnected hybrid systems is discussed in detail through a case-by-case study.</p>
			<p class="abs more">Third, we consider the problem of stabilizing a switched linear system with a completely unknown disturbance using sampled and quantized state feediiback. The switching is assumed to be slow enough in the sense of combined dwell-time and average dwell-time, each individual mode is assumed to be stabilizable, and the data rate is assumed to be large enough but finite. By extending the approach of reachable-set approximation and propagation from an earlier result on the disturbance-free case, we develop a communication and control strategy that achieves a variant of input-to-state stability with exponential decay. An estimate of the disturbance bound is introduced to compensate for the unknown disturbance, and a novel algorithm is designed to adjust the estimate and recover the state when it escapes the range of quantization.</p>
			<p class="abs more">Last, motivated by the connection between the minimum data rate needed to stabilize a linear time-invariant system and its topological entropy, we examine a notion of topological entropy for switched systems with a known switching signal. This notion is formulated in terms of the number of initial points such that the corresponding trajectories approximate all trajectories within a certain error, and can be equivalently defined using the number of initial points that are separable up to a certain precision. We first calculate the topological entropy of a switched scalar system based on the active rates of its modes. This approach is then generalized to nonscalar switched linear systems with certain Lie structures to establish entropy bounds in terms of the active rate and eigenvalues of each mode.</p>
