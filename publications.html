    <span id="absYLTACShow" style="display: none;"><a class="absToggle" onclick="absHide('absYLTACShow'); absShow('absYLTACHide')">&uarr;Abstract:</a> We study the problem of stabilizing a switched linear system with a completely unknown disturbance using sampled and quantized state feedback. The switching is assumed to be slow enough in the sense of combined dwell-time and average dwell-time, each individual mode is assumed to be stabilizable, and the data rate is assumed to be large enough but finite. By extending the approach of reachable-set approximation and propagation from an earlier result on the disturbance-free case, we develop a communication and control strategy that achieves a variant of input-to-state stability with exponential decay. An estimate of the disturbance bound is introduced to counteract the unknown disturbance, and a novel algorithm is designed to adjust the estimate and recover the state when it escapes the range of quantization.</span>

We consider a scenario where the plant's state is measured by a sensor that communicates with the controller through a network. Variable communication delays and clock jitter do not permit a perfect synchronization between the clocks of the sensor and controller. We investigate limitations on the clock offset tolerable for stabilization of the feedback system. For a process with a scalar-valued state, we show that there exists a tight bound on the offset above which the closed-loop system cannot be stabilized with any causal controllers. For higher dimensional plants, if the plant has two distinct poles, then the effect of clock mismatches can be canceled with a finite number of measurements, and hence there is no fundamental limitation. We also consider the case where the measurements are subject to quantization in addition to clock mismatches. For first-order plants, we present necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for stabilizability, which show that a larger clock offset requires a finer quantization.</span>

We show that, providing the switching signals neither switch too frequently nor activate non-ISS subsystems for too long, a small-gain theorem can be used to conclude global asymptotic stability (GAS) of the interconnected system. For each switched system, with the constraints on the switching signal being modeled by an auxiliary timer, a correspondent hybrid system is defined to enable the construction of a hybrid ISS Lyapunov function. Apart from justifying the ISS property of their corresponding switched systems, these hybrid ISS Lyapunov functions are then combined to establish a Lyapunov-type small-gain condition which guarantees that the interconnected system is globally asymptotically stable.</span>

Provided that the switching is slow in the sense of average dwell-time and the active time of non-ISS modes is short in proportion, suitable feedback controls are designed to achieve input-to-state practical stability (ISpS) with an arbitrarily small constant. We devise such feedback controls by extending a previous small-gain theorem on stability of interconnected switched systems to the ISpS context, and proposing a novel Lyapunov-based gain-assignment scheme.</span>

We analyze two existing methods of constructing Lyapunov functions for the interconnection based on candidate ISS Lyapunov functions for subsystems, small-gain conditions, and auxiliary timers modeling restrictions on jump frequency in terms of average dwell-time and reverse average dwell-time. We compare their feasibility and limitations for different types of subsystem dynamics, and examine a case that the combination of them is needed to establish global asymptotic stability.</span>

The switching is slow in the sense of combined dwell-time and average dwell-time, while the active mode is unknown except at sampling times. Each mode of the switched system is stabilizable, and the disturbance admits an unknown bound. A communication and control strategy is designed to achieve practical stability and exponential convergence w.r.t. the initial state with a nonlinear gain on the disturbance, provided the data-rate meets given lower bounds. Compared with previous results, a more involved algorithm is developed to handle effects of the unknown disturbance based on employing an iteratively updated estimate of the disturbance bound and expanding the over-approximations of reachable sets over sampling intervals from the case without disturbance.</span>

With the constraints on the switching signal being modeled by a novel auxiliary timer, a hybrid system is defined so that the solutions to the two systems are correspondent. After the construction and verification of an ISS Lyapunov function, ISS of all complete solutions to the hybrid system, and therefore all solutions to the switched system, is conveniently proved.</span>
